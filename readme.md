I have created VM and one bucket for website data and second one for backend data. I have had issue with adding .jpg to site, code was consulted with other participants (seems to be OK) but it is not working. My main issue during tast was that terraform was creating again and again resources I am already having. I have deleted vms, buckets, even i have created new repo but error has occured. Beside of it i have created resources and documentation for website. I am happy to hear feedback how to overcome issue with resources (have not found answer in google) and .jpg (seems to be good but it is not appearing on webside)
